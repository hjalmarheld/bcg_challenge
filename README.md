# ClientCo Churn Prediction

The goal of this project is to create a churn prediction pipeline that will enable ClientCo to identify churners and take action. The next steps will be to help ClientCo prioritize the clients predicted to churn based on the value gained, in order to optimize their sales budget.


## üöÄ Getting started with the repository


- Firstly the data needs to be fetched and placed in the data folder, if needed update the paths in *config.py*.

- Secondly, get the required packages. The data pipeline is entirely *Polars* based and the base model is *LightGBM*, if needed, install the packages by running:

```
pip install polars lightgbm
```

- Lastly the model can be ran using the following commands from the source of the repo: 
 
```
python main.py
```

## üóÇ Repository structure

Our repository is structured in the following way:

```
|bcg_challenge
   |--data
   |-----data_pipeline.py
   |-----transaction data
   |-----relationship data
   |-----model output
   |--cache (optional)
   |-----cached processed data
   |--model
   |-----model_pipeline.py
   |-----model.py
   |--config.py
   |--main.py
   |--README.md
   |--logs.csv
```
